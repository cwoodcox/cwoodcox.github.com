# Why chuck?

Why you ask? Why the nickname that has little to nothing to do with my real 
name?

Well, I owe that to a friend of mine. She was riding in my car, and she decided
that I sure do say “good grief” a lot. It was settled, she decided to call me 
Charlie Brown for the rest of my days.

She kept up with it too. However, after a while, it became much too long. 
Charlie Brown is quite a mouthful for a nickname. So, she went with the abridged 
version preferred by “Peppermint” Patty, chuck. She called me that until the end
of sophomore year.

I didn’t see her for a while after that, but one day wandered into the yearbook 
room. They were playing Medal of Honor, and I just had to join in. However, I 
was largely unknown in the yearbook program. Using chuck as my player name, I 
played every day for almost a week. Since nobody there knew my real name, they 
just called me chuck, and it stuck.

That’s my story.
