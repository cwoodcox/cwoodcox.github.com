# Sprinklers and Raspberry Pi
Building a little board just like the one I demo'd at MountainWest RubyConf is super duper easy.

## Shopping List
These are the exact things that I used. You can compare specs and change it up. I'll put together a better list soon.

- [Sharp 8A Solid-State Relay](http://www.parallax.com/Store/Components/Other/tabid/157/ProductID/657/List/0/Default.aspx?SortField=ProductName,ProductName)
- [25.2V CT 2.0A Heavy-Duty Chassis-Mount Transformer with Lead](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2102703&filterName=Type&filterValue=Transformers)
- [RadioShackÂ® Universal Solderless Breadboard](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12165713) (I highly recommend NOT using this one. Even RS's modular boards are better.)
- [Solderless Breadboard Jumper Wire Kit](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103801)
- [75-Ft. UL-Recognized Hookup Wire (20AWG)](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2049743)
- [1/8-Watt Carbon Film Resistors (500-Piece Value Pack)](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2994585)

You'll also need your typical wire strippers/cutters, and I highly recommend wire nuts or butt splices. Electrical tape is annoying.
