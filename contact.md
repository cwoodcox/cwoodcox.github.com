# Contact

I'm [@cwoodcox on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cwoodcox), and I'm kinda noisy,
but I like followers, and I do tweet some useful stuff from time to time. I'm
always on, almost always respond to mentions. Follow me!

If you're not Twitterly inclined, or would prefer to talk to me via e-mail, I'm
happy to reply. Hit me up at
[corey.woodcox@gmail.com](mailto:corey.woodcox@gmail.com) and I'll respond as
soon as I can.
